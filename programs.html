    <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <p>GlobalConnect programs are built around one core principle: co-creation. We don‚Äôt drop in with prepackaged solutions‚Äîwe listen first, then build together. Whether it‚Äôs education, outreach, or mentorship, every initiative is shaped by the voices of the communities we serve.</p>
    <p>We believe that real impact comes from shared ownership. That‚Äôs why every program is designed to be adaptive, inclusive, and locally led. We don‚Äôt just deliver‚Äîwe empower.</p>

      <h3>üìö Education Access</h3>
      <p>We provide tutoring, school supplies, and digital literacy workshops for students in underserved areas. Our goal is to close the opportunity gap and empower lifelong learners. From after-school tutoring to parent-led learning circles, we build environments where education is a right‚Äînot a privilege.</p>

      <h3>üëê Outreach & Care Kits</h3>
      <p>From hygiene kits to emergency food packs, we deliver essentials with dignity. Each kit is customized to local needs and distributed with care and consistency. We host seasonal drives, partner with shelters, and ensure every delivery is a moment of connection‚Äînot just a transaction.</p>

    <div class="program-card">
      <h3>ü§ù Mentorship & Leadership</h3>
      <p>We pair youth with mentors who guide, support, and inspire. Our leadership labs help participants build confidence, resilience, and community impact skills. Many of our mentees become mentors themselves‚Äîproof that transformation is contagious when nurtured with care.</p>

    <div class="program-card">
      <h3>üíª Digital Empowerment</h3>
      <p>We offer training in basic tech skills, online safety, and remote learning tools‚Äîespecially for communities with limited access to digital infrastructure. From device donations to hands-on workshops, we help bridge the digital divide with empathy and inclusion.</p>

      <h3>üåç Community Co-Creation</h3>

  <h2>✨ Our Story</h2>
  <p>GlobalConnect began with a simple belief: <strong>everyone deserves opportunity</strong>.</p>
  <p>It started with care kits—hand-packed, heart-led, and delivered to those facing hardship. What began as a grassroots effort quickly grew into something deeper: a community of action, a framework of empowerment, and a culture of connection.</p>
  <p>We saw that real change doesn’t come from charity alone—it comes from systems. Systems that uplift, equip, and ripple outward. So we built them.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Mentorship programs</strong> that nurture leadership and self-worth</li>
    <li><strong>Digital empowerment sessions</strong> that unlock access, confidence, and voice</li>
    <li><strong>Community activations</strong> that celebrate culture, resilience, and shared humanity</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Today, GlobalConnect is powered by volunteers, guided by lived experience, and fueled by a belief that every person has something to give—and something to become.</p>
  <p>We are <strong>architects of dignity</strong>. We build frameworks that empower others to lead, create, and thrive. Whether it’s a youth discovering their voice, a parent gaining tech confidence, or a volunteer finding purpose—we rise together.</p>
  <p>One story. One step. One person at a time.</p>

  <!-- Our Story -->
  <section data-aos="fade-up">
    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>GlobalConnect began with a simple belief: every person deserves dignity, opportunity, and someone who shows up. What started as a grassroots outreach initiative—just a few volunteers handing out care kits—has grown into a global movement of resilience and shared humanity.</p>
    <p>We’ve served in crowded classrooms, street corners, refugee camps, and rural villages. We’ve delivered essentials in the rain, hosted workshops in borrowed halls, and built trust one conversation at a time. Our work is not transactional—it’s relational. Every kit, every session, every outreach moment is a thread in a larger tapestry of dignity and resilience.</p>
    <p>Today, GlobalConnect operates across multiple regions, powered by volunteers, educators, and outreach coordinators who believe in second chances and long-term support. We’re not just responding to need—we’re building systems of dignity and opportunity that ripple outward.</p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p><strong>To empower underserved communities through education, outreach, and volunteer-led programs that foster resilience, dignity, and opportunity.</strong></p>
    <p>Our mission is not a slogan—it’s a promise. A promise to meet people where they are, honor their stories, and walk with them toward a future of possibility.</p>

    <div class="grid">
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Dignity</h3>
        <p>Every person deserves to be seen, heard, and respected. We honor the humanity in every story, and we build programs that reflect that truth.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Consistency</h3>
        <p>We show up—again and again. Our impact is built on trust, and trust is built over time. We don’t just visit—we stay.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Collaboration</h3>
        <p>We co-create with communities, not for them. Our programs are shaped by local voices, lived experience, and shared leadership.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Resilience</h3>
        <p>We believe in second chances, long-term support, and the power of showing up even when it’s hard. We walk with people through setbacks and breakthroughs alike.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Stewardship</h3>
        <p>Every resource, every volunteer hour, every donation is handled with care and accountability. We operate with transparency and purpose.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Presence</h3>
        <p>We believe that being there—physically, emotionally, consistently—is one of the most powerful forms of service. Our volunteers don’t just deliver—they connect.</p>

  <!-- Our Story -->
  <section class="our-story" data-aos="fade-up">
    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>GlobalConnect began with a simple belief: every person deserves dignity, opportunity, and someone who shows up. What started as a grassroots outreach initiative—just a few volunteers handing out care kits—has grown into a global movement of resilience and shared humanity.</p>

    <p>In our earliest days, we operated out of borrowed spaces and backpacks. Volunteers walked neighborhoods, listened to stories, and offered what they could—meals, mentorship, or simply presence. We learned that transformation doesn’t come from grand gestures—it comes from consistency, compassion, and connection.</p>

    <p>We’ve served in crowded classrooms, street corners, refugee camps, and rural villages. We’ve delivered essentials in the rain, hosted workshops in borrowed halls, and built trust one conversation at a time. Our work is not transactional—it’s relational. Every kit, every session, every outreach moment is a thread in a larger tapestry of dignity and resilience.</p>

    <p>As word spread, so did our reach. We partnered with local leaders, educators, and organizers who understood their communities deeply. Together, we co-created programs that reflected real needs: tutoring for students falling behind, care kits for families in crisis, mentorship for youth navigating uncertainty.</p>

    <p>We’ve seen students who once struggled now lead peer workshops. We’ve watched single mothers become community advocates. We’ve supported youth who’ve gone from surviving to thriving. These stories aren’t exceptions—they’re the reason we exist.</p>

    <p>Today, GlobalConnect operates across multiple regions, powered by volunteers, educators, and outreach coordinators who believe in second chances and long-term support. We’re not just responding to need—we’re building systems of dignity and opportunity that ripple outward.</p>

    <p>We know that real change takes time. It takes listening, showing up, and staying. That’s why we’re here—not just for the moment, but for the journey.</p>

  <!-- Our Mission -->
  <section class="our-mission" data-aos="fade-up">
    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p><strong>To empower underserved communities through education, outreach, and volunteer-led programs that foster resilience, dignity, and opportunity.</strong></p>

    <p>We believe that transformation begins with trust—and that every person, regardless of background or circumstance, deserves access to the tools that help them thrive. Our mission is not just to serve, but to stand alongside—to build, uplift, and inspire.</p>

    <p>Our programs are designed to be adaptive, inclusive, and community-driven. We don’t impose solutions—we co-create them. Whether it’s a mentorship initiative, a food distribution drive, or a digital literacy workshop, every offering is shaped by the voices of those we serve.</p>

    <p>We are committed to showing up consistently, listening deeply, and acting with integrity. Our mission is not a slogan—it’s a promise. A promise to meet people where they are, honor their stories, and walk with them toward a future of possibility.</p>

    <p>We believe in building bridges—not silos. In creating access—not barriers. In fostering leadership—not dependency. Our mission is rooted in the belief that when communities are empowered, they become agents of their own transformation.</p>

  <!-- Core Values -->
  <section class="core-values" data-aos="fade-up">
    <h2>Our Values</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Dignity:</strong> Every person deserves to be seen, heard, and respected. We honor the humanity in every story, and we build programs that reflect that truth.</li>
      <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> We show up—again and again. Our impact is built on trust, and trust is built over time. We don’t just visit—we stay.</li>
      <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> We co-create with communities, not for them. Our programs are shaped by local voices, lived experience, and shared leadership.</li>
      <li><strong>Resilience:</strong> We believe in second chances, long-term support, and the power of showing up even when it’s hard. We walk with people through setbacks and breakthroughs alike.</li>
      <li><strong>Stewardship:</strong> Every resource, every volunteer hour, every donation is handled with care and accountability. We operate with transparency and purpose.</li>
      <li><strong>Presence:</strong> We believe that being there—physically, emotionally, consistently—is one of the most powerful forms of service. Our volunteers don’t just deliver—they connect.</li>
    </ul>

      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>GlobalConnect is a U.S.-based nonprofit organization dedicated to empowering underserved communities through education, outreach, and volunteer-led initiatives. We believe that every individual deserves access to opportunity, dignity, and the tools to thrive—regardless of background, geography, or circumstance.</p>
      <p>Founded in 2025, GlobalConnect began as a grassroots movement focused on care kit distribution and mentorship. Today, we operate across regions with scalable programs, a global mindset, and a commitment to measurable impact. Our work is guided by compassion, driven by data, and powered by people.</p>

    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>GlobalConnect was born out of a simple but powerful idea: that small acts of service can spark profound change. In our earliest days, volunteers assembled care kits, mentored youth, and hosted community conversations. These efforts quickly grew into a coordinated network of programs addressing education gaps, economic hardship, and social isolation.</p>
      <p>As our reach expanded, so did our infrastructure. We built digital platforms, launched training initiatives, and partnered with local leaders to co-create solutions. Today, GlobalConnect is a growing coalition of changemakers—united by purpose, driven by impact.</p>

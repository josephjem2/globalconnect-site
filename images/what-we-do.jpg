A detailed, engaging image that showcases the three core activities of GlobalConnect: delivering care kits, mentoring youth, and providing vocational training. This could be a triptych or a single image with three distinct panels. The first panel should show a volunteer handing a care kit to a grateful recipient. The second panel should depict a mentor and mentee engaged in a positive, supportive conversation. The third panel should show a vocational training session in progress, with participants learning a new skill. The image should be visually cohesive, with a consistent color palette and style. The GlobalConnect logo should be present in each panel.

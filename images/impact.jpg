A powerful, data-driven image that visualizes the impact of GlobalConnect's work. This could be an infographic-style image that presents the key statistics from the 'Our Impact' section in a visually appealing way. The image should use a clean, modern design, with a mix of icons, charts, and text. The four key stats (12,500 care kits delivered, 3,800 students supported, 420+ volunteers engaged, 94% program satisfaction) should be prominently displayed. The GlobalConnect logo and a call to action (e.g., 'Join Us in Making a Difference') should be included.
